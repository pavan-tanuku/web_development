# Random Password Generator

A **Random Password Generator** built using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`.  
It is a **beginner-friendly** web application that generates a random password with a fixed length.  
This project focuses on learning **JavaScript logic**, **DOM manipulation**, and the usage of JavaScript **built-in APIs**.

## Features
- Generates a **12-character fixed-length password**
- Ensures minimum requirements:
  - At least **1 uppercase alphabet**
  - At least **1 lowercase alphabet**
  - At least **1 number**
  - At least **1 special symbol**
- Show/Hide password for security
- Copy the generated password to the clipboard
- **DOM manipulation** for *Copied!* confirmation

---

## Technologies Used
- `HTML`
- `CSS`
- `JavaScript`

---

## What I Learned from This Project
- Writing JavaScript logic
- Implementing Show/Hide password functionality
- Developing UI using CSS
- Using built-in **Clipboard API** in JavaScript

---

## How It Works
1. Click the *Generate* button to generate a password
2. Use the *Show/Hide* eye icon to view or hide the password
3. Click the *Copy* button to copy the password to the clipboard
4. The user gets a confirmation message *Copied!*

## Future Improvements
- Allow users to select password length (8–20)
- Add a password strength indicator
- Show history of generated passwords
